# Pokenoki

Pokenoki is born by a fusion between Pokemon and the company which gave me this challenge, Enoki. This project is a website to shuffle Pokenoki cards and add them in your deck. Do you want to give it a try? üëå

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

It was really challenging to focus on front-end and especially the structure of the website. I had a lot of fun working on this subject despite the difficulties.

I had some problems making my project responsive. It is something that I can practice more for next projects.

I am also frustrated to present an incomplete project. For example, I wanted to change the Pokenoki icon by attributing a variable instead of a number inside the url image.
